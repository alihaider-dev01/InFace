## 📌 What This Project Does

- Uses your webcam to detect a face in real-time
- Estimates your **age**, **gender**, and **emotion**
- Draws facial landmarks and overlays predictions live on screen
- No server, no upload — everything runs in your browser

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ Real-time webcam scanning  
✅ AI-based age & gender prediction  
✅ Emotion detection via facial expressions  
✅ No login or data storage  
✅ Lightweight and responsive design  
✅ Purely client-side (no backend)

---

## 🧠 Background / How I Built It

InFace started as an experiment in real-time facial analysis using browser-based AI. The goal was to create a **portfolio-ready, company-attractive** project that shows:

- Camera input handling
- Real-time analysis using pre-trained models
- AI interaction using Hugging Face APIs
- Clean, mobile-friendly UI
- GitHub Pages hosting (for demo accessibility)

The final version uses **MediaPipe’s FaceMesh** for facial landmark detection, and Hugging Face inference APIs for **age & gender classification**.

## 🧰 Tech Stack Used

| Part        | Tech                                      |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Frontend    | HTML, CSS, JavaScript                     |
| AI Models   | MediaPipe (FaceMesh), Hugging Face APIs   |
| Hosting     | GitHub Pages                              |
| Extras      | Canvas drawing, camera access APIs        |

## 📈 Why It Matters

InFace is more than a demo — it’s a **showcase of applied AI skills** in action. Real-time AI interaction is a critical skill across industries, and this tool demonstrates how to:

- Build client-only AI tools (zero backend)
- Apply facial landmarks for live analysis
- Integrate cloud AI models via API (Hugging Face)
- Deliver a sleek user experience

## 💼 For Companies & Recruiters

🧠 Want to see my AI + Frontend + UX skills? This is a live proof.  
🚀 Want fast product prototypes without complex backend setup? This project is a working template.  
🔒 Concerned about privacy? InFace doesn’t store or upload anything — it all happens in your browser.

## 🎓 For Students, Educators & Developers

- Learn how to combine **MediaPipe**, **Web APIs**, and **external AI models**
- Adapt this into any educational demo, research UI, or browser-based AI utility
- Clone and remix freely for your own AI tools

---

## 🌟 Why It Stands Out

✅ Fully client-side — no data sent to server  
✅ Combines local detection + cloud AI inference  
✅ Practical UX — not just code, but experience  
✅ Built from scratch with real-world use cases in mind  
✅ Clean, cyberpunk-inspired UI
